This is a powerful [Discord bot](https://discord.js.org) that mutes dead players in [TTT](http://ttt.badking.net) (Garry's Mod - Trouble in Terrorist Town)

## Getting Started
If you need a step-by-step tutorial, follow my [guide at Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1351369388)

### Prerequisites
- You need a fully set-up Garry's Mod Server with the TTT gamemode
- You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed

### Installation
1. Clone this repository (to e.g. your home folder) and install the requirements
     ```bash
     cd ~
     git clone https://github.com/marceltransier/ttt_discord_bot.git
     cd ttt_discord_bot
     npm install --prefix ./discord_bot/
     ```
2. Rename the `config.json.example` to `config.json`

3. Create Discord Bot, invite him to your server and paste the token in the config

   - if you don't know how to, follow [this guide](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)

   - insert the bot token at `discord -> token` in the config.json
   
   - grant the bot the permission to mute members

4. Insert the Guild *(Server)* ID and the channel ID in the config

   - if you don't know how to get these ID's, follow [this guide](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-)

   - insert the guild ID at `discord -> guild` and the channel ID of the voice channel in which the bot should mute dead players at `discord -> channel` in the config.json

5. Add the addon to the Garry's Mod server

   - Move the `gmod_addon` folder to `garrysmod/addons` and name it suitable e.g. `ttt_discord_bot`

   - ~~Or add the [Workshop object](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1350367721) to  the servers collection~~

### Usage

- Start the bot by running the `node` command with the `ttt_discord_bot/discord_bot/` directory
- Connect your Steam Account with the bot by typing `!discord YourDiscordTag` in the in-game chat, e.g. `!discord marcel.js#4402`. If you're lazy and there is nobody else with your discord discriminator (`#4402`) in the TTT channel, it's enough if you use this, e.g. `!discord 4402`
- If you're in the **configured voice channel**, the game state is **in progress**, you're **connected with discord** and you die in TTT, the bot will mute you!

## Credits

- I used [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) in this project. Thanks for the easy opportunity writing a Discord bot in javascript!
- Thanks for the great Garry's Mod gamemode [Trouble in Terrorist Town](http://ttt.badking.net) I made this bot for.
